# VBA-Challenge
This is my submission for the Module 2 Challenge 

I created a script that loops through all of the sheets representing each year of stock data and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. If the change is less than 0 then the change is represented with a red color and if the change is greater than or equal to 0 then the change is represented with a green color

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock

I also added functionality to my script to return the stock with the "Greatest Percent increase", "Greatest Percent decrease", and "Greatest total volume" in a table on each sheet


Included are two documents showing the results for this Module:

- Screenshots of my excel sheets and 
- my VBA script

I also included screenshots of my VBA script
